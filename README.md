# iOS Activation Tool Suite

A complete, end-to-end solution for iOS device activation management. This repository contains both the client-side automation logic and the server-side infrastructure required to handle device activation payloads.

## Architecture Overview

The suite is divided into two core components:

- **Client Automation (`client/`)**: A Python-based utility that interacts directly with connected iOS devices via USB. It handles lifecycle management (reboots), system log analysis, and filesystem operations (AFC).

- **Server Backend (`server/`)**: A PHP application that dynamically generates device-specific activation payloads. It serves as the central authority for handling device requests and delivering the necessary configuration databases.

```


## Prerequisites

### Client-Side (macOS/Linux)

- Python 3.6+

- `libimobiledevice` (via Homebrew on macOS)

- `pymobiledevice3` (via pip)

- `curl`

### Server-Side

- PHP 7.4 or newer

- SQLite3 extension enabled

- Write permissions for cache directories


### 1. Server Deployment

Deploy the contents of the `server` directory from the release package to your web host. Ensure the `public` folder is set as the document root.

See [server/SETUP.md](server/SETUP.md) for detailed configuration steps.

### 3. Client Configuration

Update the `activator.py` script to point to your deployed server URL before running.

### 4. Run the client tool
```
sudo python3 client/activator.py
```


NOTE: The OFFLINE version will NOT work, sorry i was sick a made a mistake.
